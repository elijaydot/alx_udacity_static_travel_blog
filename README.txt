Deploy Static Website on AWS

In this project, I deployed a static website to AWS using S3, CloudFront, and IAM.

The static website is about my Tracel Blog, titled: Eli's Travel Blog

The files included are: 

index.html - The Index document for the website.
/img - The background image file for the website.
/vendor - Bootssrap CSS framework, Font, and JavaScript libraries needed for the website to function.
/css - CSS files for the website.

To access this static website, there are three(3) access points, which will show you the same index.html:

1. Cloud Front Domain Name:  https://d3o02ddap01fy9.cloudfront.net
2. website-endpoint: http://elijahudacityproject.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
3. S3 Bucket object url : http://elijahudacityproject.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
